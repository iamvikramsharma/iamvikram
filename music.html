        <h2>Heeling Effect of Music</h2>
        <br>
        <p>When you’re feeling down on yourself, do you ever put on music to lift your spirits? If the answer is yes, you are certainly not alone. Music has the power to brighten our mood, reframe our perspective, and turn that frown upside down in no time flat.
<br><br>
          Music is an essential part of human existence. Listening to music leaves a major impact on each one of us. It can boost your mood, reduce stress and improve your health and overall well-being.
          <br><br>
          According to studies, the majority of people have positive experiences when listening to music; whether it’s sad, or upbeat music.
          
          <br><br>
          During times of loss, for example, listening to sad music that describes what you’re feeling can be compared to listening to an empathetic friend who truly understands what you’re going through. On the other hand, listening to upbeat music is a wonderful way to improve your mood and boost your happiness.
         <br><br> 
          Music has also been used as therapy for a long time, helping people to cope with pain, manage stress and improve memory. In fact, some researchers found that patients experienced less pain and anxiety when they listened to music before, during, or after surgery.
